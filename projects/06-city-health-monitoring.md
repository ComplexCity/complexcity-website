##### PROJECT ABSTRACT
---
With the development of urbanization and as a result of the increasing natural aging populations, one important goal of Smart City program in both China and France is to develop better health monitoring services, in order to provide elderly people healthy and independent living. As a possible approach, gerontechnology aims to provide innovative solutions both for aging people themselves and the medi- cal care staff and family in order to contribute to what is referred to as “well-aging”

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Currently there are more than two million PD patients in China. Long-term care for the PD elderly patients, traditionally provided at home in China by adult children, will become increasingly less feasible in coming decades when parents of the first generation of the one-child policy start reaching an old age and retiring.

Because PD is an irreversible disease, the early detection and intervention has been considered to be the only approach to slow down the PD process or prevent PD, for example, by supervising the PD process or guiding elderly people healthy lifestyles. Hence the overall objective of this internatio- nal cooperation project is to provide a gerontechnology solution for both Chinese and French elderly people (including PD patients, potential PD patients, and even healthy people) to prevent and inter- vene PD in the early stage.

By using the first generation gerontechnology (Information and Communication Technology, ICT), we aim to achieve (1) Alarming families; (2) Human group behavior steering; (3) perhaps developing new person services to prevent and intervene PD in the early stage.
