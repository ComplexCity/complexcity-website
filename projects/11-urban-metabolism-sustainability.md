##### PROJECT ABSTRACT
---
Our research focuses on the "Urban Metabolism" research, which has a multi-scale approach to identify synergies, structure and strategy in urban system development. The urban metabolism model offers benefits to studies of the sustainability of cities by providing a unified or holistic viewpoint to en- compass all of the activities of a city in a single model (Wolman, 1965; Kennedy, 2011). Urban metabolism is a deeply multi-disciplinary research domain focused on providing important insights into the behavior of urban systems for the purpose of advancing effective proposals for a more humane and ecologically responsible future.

The purpose of our research is to provide data, models, design and decision and evaluation tools to support for the urban system development, taking into account its different levels such as region, city, district, infrastructure, etc. interconnected by networks (e.g., municipal waste, water, energy and materials used) and characterized by social, cultural, political and economic aspect.

Therefore, our research will a) deal with issues related to the urban design between the different stakeholders by using perspective scenario and territorial industrial ecology approach, the results from this part can give us the answers about the required economic incentives and regulations as well as quality of information (scientific representative data) on the urban design decision making; and b) decision-support and evaluation tools to create and implement integrated engineering designs, social and cultural representations, for activity fulfillment networks, will be shown and produced. The decision-support, evaluation and design tools (e.g., life cycle assessment and costing, material and energy flow analysis, GIS and building information management system (BIM), product data management (PDM)) will allow urban planners to estimate the impacts of individual and societal decisions and may be used for urban-growth scenarios in circular economy logic.
