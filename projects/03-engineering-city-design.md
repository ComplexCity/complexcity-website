##### PROJECT ABSTRACT
---
Engineering design and planning of the city of the future for its citizens of all ages with its fast and dynamic evolving structure is a complex problem. This complexity results from the conjugation of a huge amount of heterogeneous data interacting with each other. Our first claim is that engineering design theories and practices can successfully be applied in the engineering design of complex city. The second claim is that modeling knowledge plays an important role for enhancing the rationality and usability of engineering models in the engineering design of complex city like Shanghai. Engineering design can be analyzed, synthesized and validated through dynamic engineering models. Developing models for describing the knowledge of engineering models can improve the quality of complexity management in the practice of the engineering design of complex cities.

We propose a model for describing the knowledge of engineering models to assist the complexity management of the design of complex cities in light of a detailed understanding of "what we want to achieve" and "how we want to achieve" relationships and transformations.

It is based on principles of axiomatic design theory structured on different levels of modeling. Axio- matic design approach considers design as interplay between what we want to achieve and how we want to achieve it. Engineering design progress through interplay and iterations between "what we want to achieve", representing functional modeling, and "how we want to achieve", representing structural modeling. This model can be applied to great advantage in the design of complex city. The proposed model can capture better the knowledge of engineering models because it provides: (a) a disciplined way of thinking, (b) a disciplined way of modeling and (c) modeling tools and techniques.
