##### PROJECT ABSTRACT
---
Low-carbon economy will be the new engine to promote the sustainable development of human society. Concerned about theoretical and practical problems raised by the smart city and the low carbon development economics, has become a major academic and applied topics. Energy management is one of these issues.

Current approaches or tools clearly showed limitations in their ability to capture and influence how actors manage their daily consumption and production of energy in asustainable way. In this context, Services, Usages and especially Practices related directly or indirectly to Energy could be new unit of analysis to answer these previous limitations and provide an innovative approach toenergy and environment issues.

This project proposes a platform to identify the Practices as interconnected, multidimensional hete- rogeneous entities. It will handle massive flows of information from multiple sources and be of multiple types. The platform based on Assemblage Theory will be able to model Practices users' structures. The project will provide end-users tools for analysis and visualization of their own practices parts of their lifestyles. With recommendations from the platform, users, communities or cities will support and promote sustainable lifestyles and practices with reducedimpact on environment as well as optimized energy consumption or production.

This innovative approach aims to identify, calculate and model these multi-dimensional structures of practices from end-users. They are built on massive data flows in order to help end-users manage more efficiently the energy production and consumption based on their lifestyles.
