- question: Do you work solely on China and/or Shanghai city?
  answer: Being a sino-french lab with a platform in Shanghai does not mean we work only on chinese city or on Shanghai. Our researchers do research on many cities in France, China or internationally. We gather data on many cities in the world as well. The choice to gather data or work on a specific city is people driven as the studies of the lab emphasize a deep understanding of the cities only possible by collaborating with people knowing these cities very well (whether sociologist, urbanist, designer, architect or simple citizens).

- question: Do you offer funding for your hosted project?

ComplexCity lab can help you to find fund to incubate your project and offer you visibility for it but it only concerns short mobility funding. Researchers are invited to submit their project to their national, bi-national or international call for funding. ComplexCity lab team can also provide a strategic foresight for these funding and any specific China-France funding proposal.
