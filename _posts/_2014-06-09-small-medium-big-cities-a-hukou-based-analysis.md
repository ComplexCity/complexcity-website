In recent years, the Chinese State Council has proposed implementing a policy encouraging migrant workers to settle down in small and medium cities, but not in the largest 40 cities. Some commentators have high hopes for this policy, claiming that it can help the country avoid the "big city disease" by channeling migrants to small and medium cities. Dr Kam Wing Chan argues that it is a gross misunderstanding and provides her analysis as the reality of China’s investment is still tilted towards major cities, and large cities develop more quickly. With the current local government revenue system dominated by land sales revenues, local governments of small cities do not have the means to develop the cities because their land cannot be sold at a good price.
However, it is not absolutely impossible to attract migrant workers to medium or small cities. We provide the analysis based on Hukou system, which plays a dominant role in the wave of migrants in China's unprecedented urbanization.

From the economic perspective, according to comprehensive and publicly available statistical data, the cost of "urbanizing" each person is approximately 20,000 yuan in a small city, and 100,000 yuan in a large one[]. According to Dr Chan's calculation of the overall cost and fiscal impact of urbanizing the entire floating population and assuming that the migrant population will reach 300 million by 2030, offering urban hukou to 20 million people per year in big cities would cost 50 billion yuan, aka 0.1 % of China’s GDP, a figure within the country’s affordability. This conclusion supports our assumption that, since big cities are capable to afford the cost of urbanizing the floating population, the small or middle ones should do better as the cost of "per-capita urbanization" is much lower. Therefore, is it sustainable to continue the policy and investment preference to big cities, or should we reconsider the role of small or medium size cities in China's urbanization?

From the psychological perspective, considering why migrants prefer going to large cities, the reason is mainly because such cities have the wherewithal and talents to be the most efficient and most productive in many aspects. However, without convenient access to advanced public service provided by large cities (due to lack of legitimate Hukou), the migrant workers can not really enjoy their life and take fully advantage of public service such as education, health insurance, mortgage, etc. This has been proved by numerous surveys on migrants' feelings about the big cities they live and work in and why most of them are willing to leave these cities after they are retired. 

President of China Xi Jinping stressed that, the reform of Hukou system is the key factor to China's future urbanization. Promoting the reform of Hukou system is a major movement about the transfer of hundreds of millions of agricultural population to urban inhabitants. The general policy requirements the fully liberalization of restraints of settling in towns and small cities, orderly releasing the limits of settling in medium cities, reasonably determining settling conditions in large cities, strictly controlling the population in megalopolis. The reform of Hukou system is a complex systematic program, which needs both overall consideration and acting according to different conditions. It is important to respect the wishes of urban and rural residents about where they would like to settle, and reasonably guide the expectations and choices of the migrants.
