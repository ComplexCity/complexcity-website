What is a city? Definition of cities depends of various factors, such as culture, size, and so on. To better understand the essence of cities, it is helpful to retrospect the visions of cities from prestigious philosophers, intellectuals, and scholars to gain new thoughts, especially those who have a great influence on the process of urban development and related studies. 

##Famous Scholastic Views  in Different Eras
###Ancient Greece: Plato and Aristotle
Plato's philosophical views contained many societal implications, especially on the idea of an ideal city. He argued that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul. Specifically, Productive (Workers) — the merchants, carpenters, farmers, etc. These correspond to the "appetite" part of the soul. Protective (Warriors) — those who are adventurous, strong and brave in the armed forces. These correspond to the "spirit" part of the soul. Governing (Rulers or Philosopher Kings) — those who are intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to make decisions for the community. These correspond to the "reason" part of the soul and are very few. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part". Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner. As Daniel A. Bell has argued, "Plato may have been favorably inclined toward Sparta whereas Aristotle, arguably, had a more balanced view of democratic rule and saw some virtues in the Athenian way".

###Ancient China: Social Class and Natural Inclusive in Urban Planning
Chinese philosophers consider urban planning under various ideas. The dominant one is to strictly regulate city size as the way to show respect to the social class division. Another one is to show natural inclusive/worship advocated by Taoism (天人合一). In "周礼，考工记" (The Rites of Zhou: Kaogongji), one of the classics of Confucianism, it described the way to build a city as "匠人营国，方九里，旁三门。国中九经九纬，经涂九轨。左祖右社，前朝后市。市朝一夫。" (When an architect measures the land and designs a walled city, the city shape should be a square with 9 Li for each edge, and each side should have 3 gates. Inside the city, there should be 9 streets from North to South, the other 9 from East to West. Each street allows 3 waggon passing through at the same time (est 18m). In the left side of the city, there should be the ancestral altars; while there should be the altars of soil and grain (representing the state) in the right side of the city. In front there is the royal palace, backwards is the market. The palace and market are each for 100 feet). This ideas, deeply rooted on Confucianism, was widely followed by many kings and emperors in China's history to build their cities as a strategy to show their supremacy and the social class. However, during the Spring and Autumn period (from approximately 771 until 476 BC), academic research on urban studies became more diverse. From the notable encyclopedic masterpiece, "Guanzi" (管子) has argued "因天材，就地利，故城郭不必中规矩，道路不必中准绳" (following the natural favorable conditions and geographic advantages, urban planning doesn't have to follow a stereotype routine). This idea has influenced the construction of some famous Chinese cities, especially those with beautiful natural scenery, such as Nanjing. Today under the circumstance that the earth is threatened by human activities and scholastic pioneers are calling for eco-city, the idea of respecting natural conditions on urban planning seems not out-of-date. Other theories include "Fengshui" (风水), it was used to locate the best spot to build a city. 
###Modern Pioneer: Le Corbusier
To better deal with the squalor of the growing Parisian slums, Le Corbusier believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the lower classes. In 1922 he presented his scheme for a "Contemporary City" for three million inhabitants (Ville Contemporaine). He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and glorified the automobile as a means of transportation. In this new industrial spirit, Le Corbusier advocated the use of modern industrial techniques and strategies to transform society into a more efficient environment with a higher standard of living on all socioeconomic levels. He forcefully argued that this transformation was necessary to avoid the spectre of revolution that would otherwise shake society. In the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in La Ville radieuse in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.

###Critical Thinkers: Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs
As America's last great public intellectual, Lewis Mumford start to think about cities from a humanistic perspective. Harshly critical of urban sprawl, Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While pessimistic in tone, Mumford argues that urban planning should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.
He continuously to explore the strategies of the optimization of cities in the Western world. Jane Jacobs drew on her observations to defend the view that successful neighborhoods are characterized by diversity. Four foundations, Jacobs argued, are necessary for diversity: a street or district should have mixed primary uses; short blocks designed to make the pedestrian feel more comfortable; a mixture of ages and types of buildings; and a dense population. Older neighborhoods often have such features; hence, they should be preserved and renovated rather than razed and replaced.


##Complex Thinking
Cities are different, yet they share some common features. Cities are planned to meet the needs of people. In different eras, people have different understanding about what a "good" city should be, and what standards or qualifications an ideal city should meet. Besides, urban studies in the West and the East are based on different philosophic foundations, which caused the diverse urban forms we see today.
In general, the view of ancient Greek thinkers can be compared to the beginning of social contract. According to Aristotle, a city is to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts. Ancient Chinese philosophers provided their opinions about urban construction mainly from the ideas of social classification and natural worship. In modern time, Le Corbusier tried to realize his fantasy of the future city with the massive application of technology. However, the priority of automobile in urban planning brought severe "city disease" which troubled hundreds of millions citizens. Critic thinkers as Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs shared noble social responsibility, and offered their solutions after observing different cities from the perspective of environmental psychology. To retrospect how human view the city, we can see it starts from an ideal conception or Utopia, then to some more realistic thoughts, such as the application of technology. Later, concerns about quality of life, social inclusive and humanity play a more and more important role . 
City is a complex system! Just like a human being, a city was founded, grew, some vanished with time, some survived, evolved, and are still developing. There is no ultimate solution to every urban predicament. Hence, it is helpful to understand the city from the complex perspectives in history, to get a closer look to the essence of a city as a whole, instead of the simple combination of small pieces.
