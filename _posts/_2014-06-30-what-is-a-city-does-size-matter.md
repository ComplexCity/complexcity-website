Different cities have different sizes. Due to different cultural and historic backgrounds, cities "grow" differently, and thus, they have different impacts on the inhabitants and hold different positions in the world. Does the size matter? One logic way to answer the question is to compare cities in various sizes through case studies. To better understand the cities worldwide instead of just from one countrty, we choose Oxford, Suzhou, and New York respectively representing cities in small, middle, and big sizes. We hope our research could inspire the further study of strategies for sustainable urban development. 

## Oxford-- Emphasizing on specific urban feature (Population: 159,994)
With the spreading prestige of the world-class Oxford University, Oxford's tolerance of nonconformism provides an ambience of learning. In "The Spirit of Cities", the author vividly described his personal experience, "Oxford has an intimacy that makes you feel at home in a way that is conductive to comtemplation and study....it is still a place that arouses such a strong feeling of intimacy that very quickly you feel comfortable and at home." This intimate feeling for both residents and visitors makes Oxford an unarguable "Lovable City".
From the perspective as a urban planner, we can see that even Oxford street names reflect the city's respect for learning. A narrow bridleway was renamed Logic Lane after the school of logicians at its north end. There is a small bridge over the canal called Aristotle Bridge, which leads to Aristotle Lane. A city that names its streets, bridges, and lanes after Aristotle or a historic school of logic is surely trying to deliver a rather specific message. Thanks to its relatively small size, Oxford is easier to emphasize on its own feature (respect for learning), and offer people a specific experience or feeling, which will give people a stronger impression and touch the softest part of their heart.


##Suzhou-- Balance between tradition and modernization (Population: 4,083,923 )
Originally founded in 514 BC, Suzhou is well-known for its rich history and classical gardens. The meticulously designed gardens are popular tourist destinations and many of them were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Besides its natural beauty, Suzhou owns an abundant legacies of culture, including its opera (Suzhou Pingtan), brocade, handicrafts (Suzhou embroidery, fans), etc. All of these make Suzhou a center of culture and art in China. Meanwhile, Suzhou is seizing every opportunity for development under China's rapid economic boom. With the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments, Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) successfully boost Suzhou's economic soar and founded the city's innovative industry.
As a middle-sized city with over 4 million residents, Suzhou is facing and will always confront the question about how to balance between tradition and modernization in a globalized world. It is both opportunity and challenge. We can see effort from all stakeholders in Suzhou (the government, NGO, inhabitants). For instance, on Suzhou bus, the stop-notification is broadcasted in both mandarin and Wu dialect (Suzhou's local dialect), as a way to preserve its local language/culture.


##New York -- Diversity rules (Population: 8.4 million)
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani has argued in his second inauguration, "I ask God to bless us and our great city--- the capital of the world now and forever." What gave Giuliani the confidence to crown New York "the capital of the world"? As Daniel A. Bell argued, "New York is the capital of the world because it's the world's economically most powerful city and also because of its great, unparalleled contributions to the world of culture." But how did the incomparable achievements of culture happen in New York? He further pointed out, "Perhaps the main reason for the explosion of new forms of culture in New York is the diversity of its immigrant pool."
New York has a long history of drawing immigrants in search of a better life. People go to New York because it is seen as the land to realize one's potential. "Different kinds of immigrants from a radically different range of ethnic. linguistic, and social backgrounds are bound to be confronted with new perspectives, to question old ways of doing things, and to innovate." It is the diversity that makes New York repeatedly resurrect itself and become the "capital of the world".


##Conclusion
Large cities are usually well-know by many because of their notable influence to the world, such as New York, Paris, Tokyo, and London. However, it doesn't imply that cities with middle or small sizes can not make a difference. Considering Jerusalem, as the "Holy city" for hundreds of millions of Christians, Muslims, and Jews, it is the unarguable center of religion only with a population of 815,300. Cities with all different sizes have their unique advantages. It is crucial to make the best of such advantages. According to the research conducted among cities with different sizes, we believe that it is beneficial for big cities to pursue sustainability by promoting diversity, complexity, and tolerance. Medium cities can focus on more about how to balance the past, present, and future development. Small cities can emphasize on simplicity, lovability, and building specific urban character (e.g. the city of Oxford has chosen to provide its scholars with the best possible intellectual and cultural climate for their minds to flourish). We are still in the process of exploring the significance of size to a city and its future, but we are pretty positive about one thing: size will not be a key factor that stops a city to become successful and lovable.
Does size matter? It's a good question!
