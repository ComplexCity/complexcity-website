According to comprehensive and publicly available statistical data, the cost of "urbanizing" each person is approximately 20,000 yuan in a small city, and 100,000 yuan in a large one. With Kam Wing Chan's calculation of the overall cost of urbanizing the entire floating population and its fiscal impact, offering urban hukou to 20 million people per year (assuming that the migrant population will reach 300 million by 2030) in big cities would cost 50 billion yuan, aka 0.1 % of China’s GDP, a figure within the country’s affordability. It brings out the position we stand for, since big cities are capable to afford the cost of urbanizing the floating population, the small or middle ones should be better as the cost of "per-capita urbanization" is lower. Is it sustainable to continue the policy and investment preference to big cities, or should we reconsider the role of small or medium size cities in China's urbanization? 


习近平强调，推进人的城镇化重要的环节在户籍制度，加快户籍制度改革，是涉及亿万农业转移人口的一项重大举措。总的政策要求是全面放开建制镇和小城市落户限制，有序放开中等城市落户限制，合理确定大城市落户条件，严格控制特大城市人口规模，促进有能力在城镇稳定就业和生活的常住人口有序实现市民化，稳步推进城镇基本公共服务常住人口全覆盖。户籍制度改革是一项复杂的系统工程，既要统筹考虑，又要因地制宜、区别对待。要坚持积极稳妥、规范有序，充分考虑能力和可能，优先解决存量，有序引导增量。要尊重城乡居民自主定居意愿，合理引导农业转移人口落户城镇的预期和选择。要促进大中小城市和小城镇合理布局、功能互补，搞好基本公共服务，还要维护好农民的土地承包经营权、宅基地使用权、集体收益分配权。


根据教育部网站11日发布的一项文件，各地区、各有关部门要积极采取措施，促进就业公平。省会及以下城市用人单位招聘应届毕业生不得将户籍作为限制性条件。用人单位招聘不得设置民族、种族、性别、宗教信仰等歧视性条件，不得将院校作为限制性条件。

文件要求，各地区、各有关部门要消除高校毕业生在不同地区、不同类型单位之间流动就业的制度性障碍。省会及以下城市要放开对吸收高校毕业生落户的限制，简化有关手续，应届毕业生凭《普通高等学校毕业证书》、《全国普通高等学校毕业生就业报到证》、与用人单位签订的《就业协议书》或劳动（聘用）合同办理落户手续；非应届毕业生凭与用人单位签订的劳动（聘用）合同和《普通高等学校毕业证书》办理落户手续。

文件强调，各地区、各有关部门要严厉打击非法中介和虚假招聘，依法纠正性别、民族等就业歧视现象。加大对企业用工行为的监督检查力度，对企业招用高校毕业生不签订劳动合同、不按时足额缴纳社会保险费、不按时支付工资等违法行为，及时予以查处，切实维护高校毕业生的合法权益。

根据文件要求，高校毕业生到小型微型企业就业、自主创业的，其档案可由当地市、县一级的公共就业人才服务机构免费保管。办理高校毕业生档案转递手续，转正定级表、调整改派手续不再作为接收审核档案的必备材料。


In recent years, the State Council has proposed implementing a policy encouraging migrant
workers to settle down in small and medium cities, but not in the largest 40 cities. Some commentators have high hopes for this policy, claiming that it is an urbanisation path with “Chinese characteristics,” which can help the country avoid the "big city disease" by channeling migrants to small and medium cities. Dr. Chan argues that it is a gross misunderstanding and provides her analysis as the reality of China’s investment is still tilted toward major cities, and large cities develop more quickly. Migrant workers have for the most part not followed policy to small cities but have moved to the large cities because of jobs. With the current local government revenue system dominated by land sales revenues, local governments of small cities do not have the means to develop the cities because the land there cannot be sold at a good price.
However, it is not totally impossible to attract migrant workers to middle or small cities. Deng Xiaoping reiterated that "some areas must get rich before others", and asserted that the wealth from coastal regions will eventually be transferred to aid economic construction inland. The theory, however, faced numerous challenges when put into practice, as provincial governments moved to protect their own interests. In spite of the difficult situation to ask provincial governments "sacrifice" part of their interests, the society won't make a progress if everyone remain a selfish attitude and ignore other cities welfare. Without effective solutions to de migrants to small or medium size cities, big cities will have to take the burden of accepting pouring migrants no matter they like it or not, and eventually, hurt every part's interests.
Considering what migrants need, the reason they go to big cities mainly include big cities have the wherewithal and talents to be the most efficient and most productive in many respects. However, without convenient access to good or advanced public service(due to lack of legitimate Hukou), the city can mean nothing to migrant workers, and this, has been proved by numerous investigations of their feelings to big cities they live and work. Therefore, instead of working hard on big cities, why don't we
